## Chat Bot

</p>
<p>
Passengers can have various types of questions; some questions need to be answered by an actual human being, but a lot of the queries can be handled by a bot reducing staffing needs of the airport. Also, a bot can be available 24x7</p>

## Customs Declaration
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
At the end of each international flight the flight crew hands over the customs declaration form to the passengers. Wouldnâ€™t it be convenient if passengers could fill the form using the airport mobile application? It can speed-up the immigration process and make keeping digital records easier.</p>

## In app service requests for Special Assistance to passengers
<p align="center">

<p>
Passengers needing special assistance can request the airport staff using the mobile application, making it convenient for the passengers and airport staff at the same time.</p>

## Airline Contact resources
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Certain passenger queries require the airline staff and finding the contact resources for the respective airport on the web is not very convenient and therefore a contact resource in the airport application could save valuable time.</p>

## In App-store and Airport rewards
<p align="center">

<p>
<p>Stores at the airport can choose to have their products added to the in-app store of the application allowing customers to buy the products within the application and then picking up the products from the store itself or getting it delivered somewhere within the airport.</p>

## Feedback / complaint section
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>To continuously keep improving the passenger experience, passenger feedbacks are essential. Also, any passenger complaints could be registered using the mobile application making the procedure convenient for passenger and staff.</p>

##  Lost and Found section
<p align="center">
<img src="Documentation/lostAndFound.png" width="270" > <img src="Documentation/lostItem.png" width="270" >
<p>
With such large number of passengers visiting the airport everyday there would be many lost or missing items. Therefore, to make the process of reporting and claiming lost items easier we want to have a lost and found section in the application.</p>
